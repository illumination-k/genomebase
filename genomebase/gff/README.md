# Genomebase GFF Reader, Writer, Converter, Linter

This library constructed based on [GFF3 specification](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md).

We added one directive, AttributeDef, to define attributes explicitly.

We provide writer, reader for Genomebase GFF format.
We also provide linter and converter for other GFF3 specification and GTF format.
